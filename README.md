# Waste Classifier Using Neural Network

## Project Description
This project develops a neural network-based waste classifier that identifies and categorizes different types of waste materials. By leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning, the classifier uses the MobileNetV3 architecture to efficiently differentiate between various waste objects.

## Features
- **Neural Network Implementation**: Utilizes a pre-trained MobileNetV3 model as the foundation through transfer learning techniques to enhance learning efficiency and accuracy.
- **Image Processing**: Integrates OpenCV for image capture and preprocessing, enabling the model to handle real-world imaging conditions.
- **Framework Utilization**: Built with TensorFlow, this project exemplifies how to apply modern deep learning frameworks to practical environmental challenges.

## Technologies Used
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Python
